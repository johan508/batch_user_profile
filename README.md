# batch_user_profile
This is a retro user profile management app first existed in the end of 19th century!
It was developed by Han Zhang in 1895.01.01. 
It will help you to manage the user profile - create, delete, search, modify. 
Suppose your company's name is JMS, you can change any name as you like.
Put this .bat file into your D drive. Otherwise you'll need to change the path.
When you first open up the batch file, a directory with your company's name will be created automatically, with 4 departments' folders - IT, HR, etc. (you can create more by yourself).
Then create a user's profile by inputting relative info (name, age, department), a text file will be created saved in the relative direcotory of his/her department.
